# Divide and Conquer approach
1. Divides big problem into subproblems that are just smaller scale instances of the same problem
2. Solve the subproblems recursively. If subproblem is small enough, solve in straight-forward manner (base case)
3. Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
